Reflection: Python vs. Excel
Excel was easier for quick tasks like creating pivot tables or checking totals â€” it was very intuitive. But when I tried to get more specific results, like sorting and filtering top products, it felt limited and more manual.

Python took a bit more effort at the beginning, but it gave me way more flexibility. I could customize everything, automate the steps, and the visuals looked more professional. In the end, Python was better for deeper analysis.


## Short Summary

This project analyzes sales data from the Superstore dataset using Python (in Google Colab) and Excel. I explored key business metrics such as sales by region, average profit by category, and top-selling products. The goal was to compare the capabilities of both tools in handling business analytics tasks.

## 2 Key Insights

1. The West region had the highest total sales, but not the highest average profit, which suggests a possible gap in efficiency or cost structure.
2. The Technology category had the highest average profit, indicating it may be the most profitable area for the business to focus on.

## Excel vs. Python Comparison

Excel was quick and easy for basic summaries like pivot tables and totals. However, it became more limiting when I needed to sort or filter complex results like the top 5 products. Python required more setup but gave me much more control, customization, and better visuals. Overall, Python was more powerful for in-depth analysis and automation.
